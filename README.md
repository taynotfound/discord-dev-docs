# Discord Developer Portal in Markdown
This repository contains scraped Markdown files of the Discord Developer Portal. While some formatting errors may exist, Scraped-Discord-Developer-Portal can still be used as a resource for Discord developers.

## Where are the files?
All of the Markdown files can be found in the /docs/ folder.

## Note
Images are currently not working. Also, some formatting may be incorrect due to the tool used to scrape the files. Nonetheless, these files can still be useful for reference and are updated regularly to reflect changes in the official documentation.

## How to contribute
Contributions are greatly appreciated! Whether it's fixing formatting issues or optimizing the tool used for the scraping process, every bit helps. To get started contributing, simply fork this repository and create a pull request with your suggested changes.

Additionally, if you notice an issue while using this resource, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the repository's GitHub page.

## Using the tool yourself
If you'd like to use the script used to scrape these files, it can be found in the /tools/ directory. The following packages are required: puppeteer, fs, path, turndown, turndown-plugin-gfm, and jsdom.

Please note that the script was tested on NodeJS version 18.15.0 on Windows. Be sure to adjust your environment and package versions if necessary before attempting to use the tool yourself. 

Thank you for using this resource!
