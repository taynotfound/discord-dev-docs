# [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/) but in Markdown

I have scraped the Discord Developer Portal Docs to markdown format. 
## Where are the Files? 
In `/docs/` are the Markdown Files.

## Note
Images are not working atm. Some stuff is not properly formatted as i did it via a script *i dont wanna go through 65 Files hlep*

If you want you can fix the Formatting issues etc or make the tool more efficient

`/tools/` has the "Tools" i used. 
You need the following packages
`puppeteer`, `fs`, `path`, `turndown`, `turndown-plugin-gfm`, `jsdom`
